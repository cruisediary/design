# danger design

Design Work and Media Kit, licensed as MIT by Orta Therox. Except the Prodotto In Cina font, which isn't mine and comes with it's own weird README/LICENSE.

### Fonts

The key font is [Prodotto In Cina](http://www.dafont.com/prodotto-in-cina.font), which is available [for free here](http://www.dafont.com/prodotto-in-cina.font). It is also embedded inside this repo in the [fonts](fonts/) folder.

### Keynote file

The keynote file for this ["Danger in 15m" talk](https://speakerdeck.com/orta/danger-in-15m) is inside the [keynote](keynote/). It's not perfect,  it wasn't made for sharing initially, and it might be out of date. However, if you improve the template I'd love a PR improving it.
